About the Game
Tic Tac Toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all spaces are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game is a draw.

This implementation allows two players to play the game on a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.
